This repository contains the code to reproduce the figures reported in the article:

Nadalin *et al.* Multi-omic lineage tracing predicts the transcriptional, epigenetic and genetic determinants of cancer evolution. *biorxiv*. https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.28.546923

Please refer to [GBC\_SUM159PT_paper](https://github.com/fnadalin/GBC_SUM159PT_paper) for instructions on how to reproduce the analyses.

To generate the figures, download the data frames from LINK, save them into a new folder called "tables" at parent level, and execute the scripts.

For feedback or questions about this repository, please contact [Francesca Nadalin](mailto:francesca@ebi.ac.uk).
